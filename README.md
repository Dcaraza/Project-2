# MoviePin

A web application that serves as a person medial library where users can "pin" movies they would like to watch and then unselect it once they have watched it.  Using the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API to search for movie titles, the user can view a brief description of the movie including; movie poster, genre, cast, director(s), year of release and ratings. The Movie database API was also used to add a trailer of the movie selected by the user to pin.
